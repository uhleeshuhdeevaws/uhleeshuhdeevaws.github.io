Hello! I'm Alicia DeVos. <br /> 
<br /> 

Currently I'm a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) advised by Motahhare Eslami and Ken Holstein. <br /> 
Broadly I'm interested in how subconscious perceptions affect trust and behavior; my work now explores how we can better identify and mitigate harmful biases in AI systems. <br /> 
<br /> 

Previously I worked at Noom and at Dow Jones, where I focused on growth through digital product experiments in the form of A/B and multivariate tests. <br /> 
Before that, I graduated from Brown University with a computer science degree (though I also completed significant writing coursework). <br /> 
<br /> 

I like to run and read for fun, but not simultaneously. <br /> 
My free time is spent watching musicals, eating ice cream, and figuring out how to pronounce "apropos". <br /> 
My favorite color is red, my favorite software application is InDesign, and my favorite punctuation marks are the en dash and the interrobang. <br />
