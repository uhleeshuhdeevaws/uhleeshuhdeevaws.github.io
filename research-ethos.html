        <p>This is my attempt at a research ethos statement. Thought I've spent a decent amount of time thinking about it, it is a work in progress, & I welcome additional thoughts. </p>
        
        <p class="top-list"><strong>I have a responsibility to</strong></p>
        
        <p class="tab"><strong>POWER</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand how the dynamics of power might shift as a result of my work</li>
                <li>Consider who might be harmed & who might be benefited / who gains & who loses power</li>
                <li>In general, aim for power to flow from those with more to those with less</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="tab"><strong>PEOPLE</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Seek the knowledge of those with relevant experience that manifests beyond typically related scholarship</li>
                <li>Center & involve those affected both intentionally & unintentionally by my work, giving them true agency in the direction & concretely valuing their work</li>
                <li>Recognize the wisdom of community members & welcome critical feedback with grace & humility</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="tab"><strong>PROBLEM-SOLVING</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Work on real, not contrived problems; create real, not contrived solutions</li>
                <li>Recognize that technological change is not always the answer; accept that external problem-solvers (e.g., outside researchers) are not always the answer</li>
                <li>Aspire to solutions that not only reduce but eliminate harm</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="tab"><strong>COMPLEXITY</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reflect the richness of human experience; avoid boxing people into unnecessary categorization</li>
                <li>Strive to capture & understand the nuances of intersectionality, of apparent contradictions, & of tensions in various tradeoffs</li>
                <li>Accept no magic solutions; be critical where criticism is due</li>
            </ul>
